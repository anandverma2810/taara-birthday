  "2025-09-18": `“What’s there after 4 days?” you ask me with cheer,
And I smile, knowing your moment is near.
Not just a date on the calendar’s line,
But a day when the stars decided to shine.

Four days remain, and I quietly smile,
Thinking of you makes the world worthwhile.
The sun seems warmer, the nights more bright,
As your birthday approaches, my heart feels light.

I don’t say enough how special you are,
But your presence shines brighter than any star.
Even from miles, your laughter I hear,
A voice that comforts, a sound so dear.

Four days away, the world will know,
A beautiful soul who makes hearts glow.
And though I may tease, call you divine,
The truth is, I’m just glad you’re in my life’s line.`,
