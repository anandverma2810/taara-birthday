    "2025-09-18": `“What’s there after 4 days?” you ask me with cheer,
And I smile, knowing your moment is near.
Not just a date on the calendar’s line,
But a day when the stars decided to shine.

Four days remain, and I quietly smile,
Thinking of you makes the world worthwhile.
The sun seems warmer, the nights more bright,
As your birthday approaches, my heart feels light.

I don’t say enough how special you are,
But your presence shines brighter than any star.
Even from miles, your laughter I hear,
A voice that comforts, a sound so dear.

Four days away, the world will know,
A beautiful soul who makes hearts glow.
And though I may tease, call you divine,
The truth is, I’m just glad you’re in my life’s line.`,

    "2025-09-19": `Three days left, and the countdown begins,
My heart feels a storm but softly within.
I wonder if you know the way that you shine,
Like a rare melody, perfectly timed.

Every photo I see makes me pause and smile,
As if distance could vanish for just a while.
The stars above seem to spell out your name,
The universe whispers, it feels the same.

Three days remain, and soon you’ll see,
How much your presence has meant to me.
You’re not just a thought that passes away,
You’re the light that stays, come night or day.`,


    "2025-09-20": `Two days more, and the world will cheer,
For the soul it’s been waiting to celebrate here.
The calendar flips, the hours pass slow,
But excitement builds more than you’ll ever know.

You may laugh when I say you’re heaven’s art,
But I can’t deny what I feel in my heart.
Perhaps it’s destiny, perhaps just chance,
But knowing you’s been life’s sweetest dance.

Two days remain, and I can’t help but say,
Your birthday feels more like a holiday.
Not just for the world, though it shines because of you—
But for me… because I’m the luckiest to have you 💖`
