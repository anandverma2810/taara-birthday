    "2025-09-18": `“What’s there after 4 days?” you ask me with cheer,
And I smile, knowing your moment is near.
Not just a date on the calendar’s line,
But a day when the stars decided to shine.

Four days remain, and I quietly smile,
Thinking of you makes the world worthwhile.
The sun seems warmer, the nights more bright,
As your birthday approaches, my heart feels light.

I don’t say enough how special you are,
But your presence shines brighter than any star.
Even from miles, your laughter I hear,
A voice that comforts, a sound so dear.

Four days away, the world will know,
A beautiful soul who makes hearts glow.
And though I may tease, call you divine,
The truth is, I’m just glad you’re in my life’s line.`,

    "2025-09-19": `Three days left, and the countdown begins,
My heart feels a storm but softly within.
I wonder if you know the way that you shine,
Like a rare melody, perfectly timed.

Every photo I see makes me pause and smile,
As if distance could vanish for just a while.
The stars above seem to spell out your name,
The universe whispers, it feels the same.

Three days remain, and soon you’ll see,
How much your presence has meant to me.
You’re not just a thought that passes away,
You’re the light that stays, come night or day.`
